# time_series_tutorial
HI! This is my work in progress as a time series tutorial. 
I'll be coding both in Python and R, because I think the more languages people know, the better. 
I'm not a PHD or something. I am just a curious economist who likes code :)

I'm doing this tutorial while I myself learn about how to code time series in R and Python. 

Hope this helps =D
